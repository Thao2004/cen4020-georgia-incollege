This About text is intentionally too long to exceed the two-hundredâ€“character limit so we can verify that the program rejects it and asks again. It keeps going with extra filler words to clearly pass the threshold for validation failure.
Curious about ML systems and analytics; enjoy mentoring peers and building features that make a difference.
